        WHY BE A WEB DEVELOPER
        WHAT IS A WEB DEVELOPER
        Web development is an amazingly satisfying profession – it’s highly dynamic, beautifully creative and ridiculously rewarding. Web development professionals say that even the master is always the learner – it is a lifelong engagement in which you will always be unravelling new things. Web development is also an enabler – you get to build things from conception to implementation, from idea to reality and its possibilities are endless. Read more here.
        “Everyone consumes the internet, but it’s a small group of people who ultimately determine what it looks like and decide how people are going to engage with it. Being a web developer means you can cross that divide and therefore engage in new and meaningful ways”
        – Hannah Salmon, Loomio Web Developer and Graduate of Dev Academy`},
        {id: 2, article: `We focus on creating a holistic education experience
        Our mission to design a rigorous yet accessible programme, driven by our unique culture, has produced a set of values that guides everything we do:
        Empathy – we care about people more than machines
        Learning – we empower students to learn more than they thought possible
        Building – we build beautiful and meaningful things
        Feedback – we listen, iterate and improve
        Impact – we celebrate technology that improves our communities
        Our curriculum has been carefully crafted in collaboration with employers and the latest research on immersive learning. We use student feedback to improve our curriculum every three weeks – a rate of change that very few educational institutions can match.
        Our course is not for the faint hearted. Be prepared to work harder than you have ever worked before. We look for individuals who have tenacity, commitment and a passion for problem solving. We do not base our admissions on prior programming experience, and you do not need to be good at maths or science to excel in the field of web development.
        Because culture is at the heart of everything we do, we look for students who will work well in a team and who fit our 3 core values: Integrity, Kindness and Effort.`},

The others put their plans into action—Rongo, the god of cultivated food, tries to push his parents apart, then Tangaroa, the god of the sea, and his sibling Haumia-tiketike, the god of wild food, join him. In spite of their joint efforts Rangi and Papa remain close together in their loving embrace. After many attempts Tāne, god of forests and birds, forces his parents apart.

        And I lived the free life of a rover
        From the murrays green basin to the dusty outback
        I waltzed my matilda all over
        Then in nineteen fifteen my country said son
        It's time to stop rambling 'cause there's work to be
        Done
        So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun
        And they sent me away to the war
        And the band played Waltzing Matilda
        As we sailed away from the quay
        And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the
        Cheers
        We sailed off to Gallipoli
        How well I remember that terrible day
        When the blood stained the sand and the water
        And how in that hell that they called suvla bay
        We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
        Johnny Turk he was ready, he primed himself well
        He showered us with bullets, he rained us with
        Shells
        And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell
        Nearly blew us right back to Australia
        But the band played waltzing Matilda

        And we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs
        Then it started all over again
        Now those who were living did their best to survive
        In that mad world of blood, death and fire
        And for seven long weeks I kept myself alive
        While the corpses around me piled higher
        Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit
        And when I woke up in my hospital bed
        And saw what it had done, Christ I wished I was
        Dead
        Never knew there were worse things than dying
        And no more I'll go waltzing Matilda
        To the green bushes so far and near
        For to hump tent and pegs, a man needs two legs
        No more waltzing Matilda for me
        So they collected the cripples, the wounded and
        Maimed
        And they shipped us back home to Australia
        The legless, the armless, the blind and insane
        Those proud wounded heroes of suvla
        And as our ship pulled into circular quay
        I looked at the place where me legs used to be
        And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me
        To grieve and to mourn and to pity
        And the band played Waltzing Matilda
        As they carried us down the gangway
        But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared
        And they turned all their faces away
        And now every April I sit on my porch
        And I watch the parade pass before me
        I see my old comrades, how proudly they march
        Reliving the or their dreams of past glory
        i see the old men, all twisted and torn
        The forgotten heroes of a forgotten war
        And the young people ask me, "what are they
        Marching for?"
        And I ask myself the same question
        And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
        And the old men still answer to the call
        But year after year their numbers get fewer
        Some day no one will march there at all

        {id: 13, article: `The Maori Jesus - James K. Baxter
        I saw the Maori Jesus
        Walking on Wellington Harbour.
        He wore blue dungarees,
        His beard and hair were long.
        His breath smelled of mussels and paraoa.
        When he smiled it looked like the dawn.
        When he broke wind the little fishes trembled.
        When he frowned the ground shook.
        When he laughed everybody got drunk.
        The Maori Jesus came on shore
        And picked out his twelve disciples.
        One cleaned toilets in the railway station;
        His hands were scrubbed red to get the shit out of the pores.
        One was a call-girl who turned it up for nothing.
        One was a housewife who had forgotten the Pill
        And stuck her TV set in the rubbish can.
        One was a little office clerk
        Who'd tried to set fire to the Government Buldings.
        Yes, and there were several others;
        One was a sad old quean;
        One was an alcoholic priest
        Going slowly mad in a respectable parish.
        The Maori Jesus said, 'Man,
        From now on the sun will shine.'
        He did no miracles;
        He played the guitar sitting on the ground.
        The first day he was arrested
        For having no lawful means of support.
        The second day he was beaten up by the cops
        For telling a dee his house was not in order.
        The third day he was charged with being a Maori
        And given a month in Mt Crawford.
        The fourth day he was sent to Porirua
        For telling a screw the sun would stop rising.
        The fifth day lasted seven years
        While he worked in the Asylum laundry
        Never out of the steam.
        The sixth day he told the head doctor,
        'I am the Light in the Void;
        I am who I am.'
        The seventh day he was lobotomised;
        The brain of God was cut in half.
        On the eighth day the sun did not rise.
        It did not rise the day after.
        God was neither alive nor dead.
        The darkness of the Void,
        Mountainous, mile-deep, civilised darkness

        {id: 21, article: `Odysseus and his men then sail through the murky night to the land of the Cyclopes, a rough and uncivilized race of one-eyed giants. After making a meal of wild goats captured on an island offshore, they cross to the mainland. There they immediately come upon a cave full of sheep and crates of milk and cheese. The men advise Odysseus to snatch some of the food and hurry off, but, to his and his crew’s detriment, he decides to linger. The cave’s inhabitant soon returns—it is the Cyclops Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon. Polyphemus makes a show of hospitality at first, but he soon turns hostile. He devours two of Odysseus’s men on the spot and imprisons Odysseus and the rest in his cave for future meals.
        Odysseus wants to take his sword to Polyphemus right then, but he knows that only Polyphemus is strong enough to move the rock that he has placed across the door of his cave. Odysseus thus devises and executes a plan. The next day, while Polyphemus is outside pasturing his sheep, Odysseus finds a wooden staff in the cave and hardens it in the fire. When Polyphemus returns, Odysseus gets him drunk on wine that he brought along from the ship. Feeling jovial, Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name. Odysseus replies that his name is “Nobody”. As soon as Polyphemus collapses with intoxication, Odysseus and a select group of his men drive the red-hot staff into his eye. Polyphemus wakes with a shriek, and his neighbors come to see what is wrong, but they leave as soon as he calls out, “Nobody’s killing me”. When morning comes, Odysseus and his men escape from the cave, unseen by the blind Polyphemus, by clinging to the bellies of the monster’s sheep as they go out to graze. Safe on board their ships and with Polyphemus’s flock on board as well, Odysseus calls to land and reveals his true identity. With his former prisoners now out of reach, the blind giant lifts up a prayer to his father, Poseidon, calling for vengeance on Odysseus.`},
        {id: 22, article: `The details of my life are quite inconsequential... very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it's breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it.`}
